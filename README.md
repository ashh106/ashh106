Let us now look at some of the nuts and bolts of C++. In particular, the top 4 lines and the bottom 2 lines that we are adding in all of our codes. What do they do?

C++ uses several predefined functions to do specific tasks like taking specific inputs and outputs.

Line 1: #include adds a 'header file' to your code.
Header files contain various predefined functions that you can use in your code.
#include <bits/stdc++.h> is a shortcut which includes all the important header files automatically to your code, so that you don't need to worry about adding any other header file.
Line 2: "using namespace std" means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
Don't worry if you don't understand how #include and using namespace std works. Just think of it as something that (almost) always appears in your program.
Line 3: A blank line. C++ ignores white space.
We use it to make the code more readable.
Line 4: Another thing that always appears in a C++ program, is int main().
This is called a function.
Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
If there are multiple functions, this is the function which is executed first.
Line 6: "cout" - We've already seen what this does.
Line 8: "return 0" ends the main function.
Line 9: Do not forget to add the closing curly bracket "}" to actually end the main function.
